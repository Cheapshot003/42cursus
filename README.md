# 42cursus
My journey through the [42vienna](https://www.42vienna.com/) curriculum
---
Libft: Recoding some standard C functions; Can be used in later projects (standard libraries are forbidden in the curriculum)

MINITALK: communication between two processes using only unix signals, pretty cool

Push_Swap: Implementing a stack in C and performing a sorting algorithm on it (WIP)
